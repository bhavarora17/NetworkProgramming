**Code Resubmitted with changes**

Code submission for HomeWork 1 by Jagannath Narasimhan (narasimhan.23@osu.edu)

The following is the structure of the directory.

HW1 has two directories in it (Client and Server), and one Makefile

Makefile can be run with the following command:

make -f Makefile

Server directory has the server code (server.c) and the server executable (server.o)
To run the server executable the following command is run:

server <port number>




Client has the client code (client.c) and also the client executable (client.o)
In order to run the executable, the following command needs to be run

client <IP Address of Server> <Port Number of Server> <File to be transferred>

Client directory also has a few sample images, and a text file which can be transferred to the server.
The Server executable must be run before the client executable is run.
