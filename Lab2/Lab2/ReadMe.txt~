The following is the structure of the directory.

HW2 has three directories in it (Client, Server and Troll), one ReadMe and one

Makefile can be run with the following command:

make -f Makefile

Server directory has the server code (server.c) and the server executable (server
To run the server executable the following command is run:

Server/server <port number>

**For our code port number that server runs on is 4000**

We then run the Server/tcpd_Server/tcpds <port number>

**The port number to be entered here is 6000**

Following this, we run the troll on port number 2500 with the commad

Troll/troll 2500

We then run the TCPD-Client on port number 2015 as below:

Client/tcpd_client/tcpdc <port number>

Client has the client code (client.c) and also the client executable (client.o)
In order to run the executable, the following command needs to be run

Client/client <IP Address of Server> <Port Number of TCPD Server> <File to be transferred>

Client directory also has a few sample images, and a text file which can be tran$
The Server executable must be run before the client executable is run.
